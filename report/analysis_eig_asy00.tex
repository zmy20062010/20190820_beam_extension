\section{Summary of the interested equations}

Here we are interested in the classical model of a piezoelectric cantilever beam energy harvester, whose model is described using the following set of equations:
\begin{equation}
    u^{\prime\prime\prime\prime} - \lambda^2 u = 0,
\end{equation}
and the accompanying boundary conditions:
\begin{equation}
    \left\{\begin{aligned}
        u(0) &= 0 \\
        u^\prime(0) &= 0 \\
        u^{\prime\prime}(1) + \frac{j\lambda \beta \alpha^2}{ j\lambda \beta + 1 } u^\prime(1) &= 0 \\
        u^{\prime\prime\prime}(1) &= 0
    \end{aligned}\right.,
\end{equation}
where $\lambda$ is the eigenvalues for the problem, $u$ denotes the displace function of the cantilever beam, $\beta$ is the dimensionless externally connected resistance, and $\alpha$ is the dimensionless piezoelectric coefficient. They can be expressed as follows
\begin{equation}
    \lambda = \omega \sqrt{ \frac{ m_p l_p^4 }{ B_p } }, \quad \beta = R_l C_p \sqrt{\frac{B_p}{m_p l_p^4}}, \quad \alpha = e_p \sqrt{\frac{l_p}{C_p B_p}},
\end{equation}
where $\omega$ is angular frequency, $m_p$ is line mass density, $l_p$ is the length of the cantilever beam, $B_p$ is the bending stiffness, $C_p$ is the inherent capacitance of the piezoelectric layer, $e_p$ is the charge accumulation number, $R_l$ is the externally connected resistance. In practical applications, dielectric property of piezoelectric materials indicate that the parameter $\beta$ is changed from a very small value, which is close to a short-circuit condition to a very large value, which corresponds to an open-circuit condition.
